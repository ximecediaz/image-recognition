# image-recognition
Using OpenCV, this program is for image recognition. The principal objective is recognize some local buildings. 
These project is only for educational purposes, specially for the Artificial Intelligence area. Employing the SIFT and SURF algorithms for keypoints detection, this data is needed for the neural network to make the comparission of each image.
