# image-recognition
Using OpenCV, this program is for image recognition. The principal objective is recognize some local buildings. 
These project is only for educational purposes, specially for the Artificial Intelligence area. Employing the SIFT and SURF algorithms for keypoints detection, this data is needed for the neural network to make the comparission of each image.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
This project was created on Ubuntu v. 16.04 using OpenCV 3 libraries,Python 3.5 and SIFT or SURF algorithms, for this project this online tutorial was founded at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/24/ubuntu-16-04-how-to-install-opencv/  . Here are the instructions for the OpenCV install and the opencv_contrib:

1.- Update and upgrade your system.

2.- Install some developer tools: pkg-config, cmake

3.- Get the necessary libraries using sudo apt-get install: libjpeg8-dev, libtiff5-dev, libjasper-dev, libpng12-dev, libgtk-3-dev, libatlas-base-dev, gfortran and python3.5-dev

4.-
